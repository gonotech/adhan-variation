# Annual Adhan Time Variation

This project visualizes the variation of Muslim prayer times (Adhan) throughout the year using the `adhan-js` library and Chart.js. It allows users to enter their location (latitude and longitude) and view the prayer times for each month of the current year, specifically for the 15th day of each month. The visualization is displayed as a line chart with separate lines for each prayer time: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha.
